# Code like a pro with AI and GitHub Copilot


This repo contains the materials for my "Code like a pro with AI and GitHub Copilot" workshop for R Ladies Philly, October 9, 2024.


## Getting set up

Most of the things I cover in this demo require some setup. Here's what you need to do to get started.

### R and RStudio

To get started with R and RStudio, you'll need to install both. You can download both by clicking on the links on the [posit website](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/).



### R and VSCode

However, since GitHub copilot has only limited functionality in RStudio, we will also be showing the expanded functionalities of copilot in VSCode. You can download VSCode from the [VSCode website](https://code.visualstudio.com/).


### GitHub Copilot (requires github account with copilot enabled, $ per month for an individual licence)

**Cost** (individual): [$10 USD per calendar month or $100 USD per year.](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/about-github-copilot/subscription-plans-for-github-copilot)
