# Code like a pro with AI and GitHub Copilot


This repo contains the materials for my "Code like a pro with AI and GitHub Copilot" workshop for R Ladies Philly, October 9, 2024.


## Getting set up

Most of the things I cover in this demo require some setup. Note that GitHub Copilot is not free and you will need a subscription to use it. You do not need to have a subscription to attend the demo though! I will also mention a *free* alternative to Copilot, called *Codium*.

If you do want to get set up to use GitHub Copilot yourself, here's what you need to do to get started.

### R and RStudio (free/open source)

To get started with R and RStudio, you'll need to install both. You can download both by clicking on the links on the [posit website](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/).

In RStudio, you will need to enable GitHub Copilot (*note:* You will need an active Copilot subscription for this to work--see below). To do this:

1. Navigate to Tools > Global Options > Copilot.

2. Check the box to “Enable GitHub Copilot”.

3. Download and install the Copilot Agent components.

4. Click the “Sign In” button.

5. In the “GitHub Copilot: Sign in” dialog, copy the Verification Code.

### R and VS Code (free/open source)

Since GitHub Copilot has limited functionality in RStudio, I will also showing the expanded functionalities of copilot that are available only in VS Code. 

You can download VS Code from the [VS Code website](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

In VS Code, you will need to install the following extensions:

- [GitHub Copilot](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=github.copilot)

- [R extension for VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=YukiUeda.r-extension-pack)



### GitHub Copilot (requires github account with copilot enabled subscription)

**Cost** (individual): [$10 USD per calendar month or $100 USD per year.](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/about-github-copilot/subscription-plans-for-github-copilot)

**Instructions**:

1. [Sign up for a GitHub account](www.github.com)
